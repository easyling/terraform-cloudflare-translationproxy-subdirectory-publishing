# Easyling Subdirectory Module
## CloudFlare page rules

This module handles publishing a project in _subdirectory mode_ via CloudFlare and its _Page Rules_ facility.

### Disclaimer: using page rules in this fashion requires a _CloudFlare Enterprise_ account

Publishing in this manner relies on using two settings in CloudFlare, _Host Header Override_ and _Resolve Override_. Of the two, _Host Overrides_ are only available in the Enterprise subscription.
